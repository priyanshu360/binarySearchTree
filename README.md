# binarySearchTree
Implemented Binary Search Tree data structure using template class in C++.

A binary search tree (BST), also called an ordered or sorted binary tree, is a rooted binary tree whose internal nodes each store a key greater than all the keys in the node's left subtree and less than those in it's right subtree. 

How to use?

1 - include "BST.h" in your source file.
2 - declare a Bst as "Bst < myDataType > myTree".



The following functionalities are provided:

1 - add(value)                 // to add some node with key = value
2 - remove(value)              // to remove some node with key = value
3 - size()                     // to get total number of node at some instance
4 - find(value)                // to check if node with key = value present or not
5 - height()                   // to get the height of tree at some instance
6 - inOrderTraversal()         // to print key of nodes in inorder
7 - preOrderTraversal()        // to print key of nodes in preorder
8 - postOrderTraversal()       // to print key of nodes in postorder
